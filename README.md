## Category Page

The following is the category page where you can see the default categories and a pie chart showing number of transactions for each category. You can also create our own category by simply adding a keyword Example below shows creating a category by the keywords (Airtime and Paybill) which later returns all transactions that have the keywords(Airtime and Paybill). Deleting a category is fairly easy by swipping left or right and confirming the deletion
